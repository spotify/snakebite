Snakebite is a python library that provides a pure python HDFS client
and a wrapper around Hadoop's minicluster. The client uses protobuf for
communicating with the NameNode and it comes in the form of a library and 
a command line interface. Currently, the snakebite client supports most
actions that involve the Namenode and reading data from DataNodes.

*Note:* all methods that read data from a DataNode are able to check
the CRC during transfer, but this is disabled by default because of
performance reasons. This is the opposite behaviour from the stock
Hadoop client.

Snakebite requires `python2` and `python-protobuf 2.4.1` or higher.
(`python3` is not supported yet)


Snakebite 1.3.x has been tested mainly against Cloudera `CDH4.1.3` 
(which is `Hadoop2.0.0`) in production. Tests passed on HortonWorks
`HDP 2.0.3.22-alpha` (protocol versions 7 and 8)

`Snakebite 2.x` has been tested on `Hortonworks HDP2.0`, `CDH5 Beta` and
ONLY supports `Hadoop 2.2.0` and up (protocol version 9)!

Installation
============

Snakebite releases are available through pypi at
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/snakebite/>

To install snakebite run:

`pip install snakebite`

To install snakebite 2.x with Kerberos/SASL support, make sure you can
install python-krbV (<https://fedorahosted.org/python-krbV/>) and then
run:

`pip install "snakebite[kerberos]"`

Since the older version of snakebite (1.3.x) supports Hadoop 1.0 (instead of Hadoop 2), you
might want to install an older version by running:

`pip install -I snakebite==1.3.x`

Note that the 1.3 branch is unmaintained and doesn't include any of the fixes in the 2.x branch.
